* multiline alignment;
* should space be represented at all? should it be just text?
* should allow custom text sizes? w/ or w/o big?
* should allow empty grid cells?
* grid row/colspan?
* regular text?
* should delims only be allowed for expression?
* should have non-textual symbols (bars)?
* should have placeholders at this level?
* browserification;
* API review;
